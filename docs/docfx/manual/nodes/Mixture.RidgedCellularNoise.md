## Description
Just like the cellular noise node, this one generate a cellular pattern but the octaves are accumulated with an absolute function, which create these small "ridges" in the noise.

Note that for Texture 2D, the z coordinate is used as a seed offset.
This allows you to generate multiple noises with the same UV.
Be careful with because if you use a UV with a distorted z value, you'll get a weird looking noise instead of the normal one.
